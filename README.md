# books
A evolving project with the main goal of chronologically documenting the books I've read. The plan is to start out small and basic, get down a solid design, and slowly integrate new features with whatever technologies I'd like to learn.

Partially inspired by Drew Roper's [annual music collection](http://2015.drewroper.com).

## Roadmap
- [ ] Static HTML site with a solid design.
- [ ] Dynamically generated site from a JSON file.
- [ ] Basic API serving static data (Rails or Express).
- [ ] RESTful API with persistent data in Postgres.
- [ ] Client side admin with authentication.
- [ ] ???
