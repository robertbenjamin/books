# books
A evolving project with the main goal of chronologically documenting the books I've read. The plan is to start out small and basic, get down a solid design, and slowly integrate new features with whatever technologies I'd like to learn.

Partially inspired by Drew Roper's [annual music collection](http://2015.drewroper.com).

## Roadmap
- [x] Static HTML site with a solid design.
- [x] Dynamically generated site from a JSON file.
- [ ] Basic API serving static data (Rails or Express).
- [ ] RESTful API with persistent data in Postgres.
- [ ] Client side admin with authentication.
- [ ] ???

## Resources
- Use [HTML5 semantic elements](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) when appropriate.
- Follow [RSCSS](http://rscss.io/index.html).
- Follow the [AirBnB JS style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
- Use [Colors.cc](http://clrs.cc) for improved colors.

## Potential Books
### Currently Reading:

- Shadow of the Hedgemon — Orson Scott Card
- The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy — William B. Irving
- The Republic — Plato (Supposedly the best of Plato's works, we all talk about him but I've never actually read anything by him so decided to go for it)
- Eloquent Javascript — Marijn Haverbeke
- The Myth of Sisyphus — Albert Camus
- The Unbearable Lightness of Being — Milan Kundera
- Trust Me, I'm Lying — Ryan Holiday
- The Signal and the Noise — Nate Silver
- The Singularity is Near — Ray Kurzweil
- A Short History of Nearly Everything — Bill Bryson
- Infinite Jest — David Foster Wallace (This is a long yet fascinating read)
- Bird by Bird — Anne Lamott
- The Power of Habit — Charles Duhigg

### Plan to Read:

- Pulp — Charles Bukowski
- 1984 — George Orwell
- A Brief History of Time — Stephen Hawking
- The Happiness of Pursuit — Shimon Edelman
- Meditations — Marcus Aurelius

### All-Time Favorites:

- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance — Robert M. Pirsig (One of my favorite ever)
- The Goldfinch — Donna Tartt (Also top 3 material)
- Flowers for Algernon — Daniel Keyes (Terrifyingly emotional book, very touching)
- How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia — Mohsin Hamid
- The Alchemist — Paulo Coelho
- The Art of War — Sun Tzu
- Vagabonding — Rolf Potts
- Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki — Haruki Murakami
- Brave New World — Aldous Huxley (Worth reading for the last few dozen pages alone, although the whole thing is fantastic)
- Speaker for the Dead — Orson Scott Card (Arguably a better book than the already fantastic Ender's Game)

### The Archive (Most to Least Recent):

- Ender's Game - Orson Scott Card (I've read this book many, many times, but am now going through the whole series)
- Principia Discordia — Malaclypse the Younger (Very strange and humorous read)
- Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? — Philip K. Dick

- Essentialism — Greg McKeown
- Ready Player One — Ernest Cline
- The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao — Junot Díaz
- Kitchen Confidential — Anthony Bourdain
- Outliers — Malcolm Gladwell (I've read a lot of criticism about Gladwell online, but decided to read Outliers to judge for myself. It was a great read! Not as much reliance on anecdotal evidence as criticizers had claimed)
- The Martian — Andy Weird

- Zero to One — Peter Thiel
- Cat's Cradle — Kurt Vonnegut
- Growth Hacker Marketing — Ryan Holiday
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy — Douglas Adams
