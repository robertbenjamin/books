        <p>“So this is it," said Arthur, "We are going to die."
        <p>"Yes," said Ford, "except... no! Wait a minute!" He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur's line of vision. "What's this switch?" he cried.</p>
        <p>"What? Where?" cried Arthur, twisting round.</p>
        <p>"No, I was only fooling," said Ford, "we are going to die after all.”</p>

        <p>“If your goal is to never make a mistake in your life, you shouldn’t look for secrets. The prospect of being lonely but right—dedicating your life to something that no one else believes in—is already hard. The prospect of being lonely and wrong can be unbearable.”</p>
