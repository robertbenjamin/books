        <p>"What if one happens to be possessed of a heart that can"t be trusted--? What if the heart, for its own unfathomable reasons, leads one willfully and in a cloud of unspeakable radiance away from health, domesticity, civic responsibility and strong social connections and all the blandly-held common virtues and instead straight toward a beautiful flare of ruin, self-immolation, disaster?"</p>

        <p>"So this is it," said Arthur, "We are going to die."
        <p>"Yes," said Ford, "except... no! Wait a minute!" He suddenly lunged across the chamber at something behind Arthur"s line of vision. "What"s this switch?" he cried.</p>

        <p>"If your goal is to never make a mistake in your life, you shouldn’t look for secrets. The prospect of being lonely but right—dedicating your life to something that no one else believes in—is already hard. The prospect of being lonely and wrong can be unbearable."</p>

If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that it"s found in every culture without exception.
